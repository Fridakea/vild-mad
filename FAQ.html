                  <br />
                  Bring several shallow containers with lids. Segregate the
                  berries by container, so the very ripe and soft berries that
                  will easily get squished (ideal for jam or juice) go in one,
                  and the sturdy berries you can use whole go in another.
                  <br />Be careful not to put too many berries on top of each
                  other—those on the bottom will soon be crushed. <br />If you
                  are out picking raspberries, blackberries or sea buckthorn,
                  which all have nasty thorns, bring gloves and wear long
                  sleeves and pants to avoid cuts and scratches.<br />
                  <br />
                  <strong> How do I clean the berries?</strong> <br />
                  <br />Clean the berries as soon as you get home by rinsing
                  them carefully in a colander, and leave them out to dry on a
                  piece of cloth. If you have a batch comprising both whole and
                  smashed berries, put a dry dish towel over a cutting board,
                  tilt the board, and pour the berries down the makeshift ramp.
                  <br />The smashed berries will have a tendency to stick to the
                  tea towel, while the whole berries will trickle down and land
                  on the table.

                  <br />
                  Bring a pair of scissors to cut the stalks, as well as a
                  basket with a moist kitchen towel in the bottom, where the
                  flowers can breathe and avoid getting squished. You can also
                  use plastic containers with a moist paper towel instead.<br />
                  <br />

                  <strong>How do I pick flowers? </strong> <br /><br />You can
                  remove most flowers with your fingers, and only get the flower
                  head without damaging the rest of the plant. Carefully put the
                  flower heads on the moist surface. <br />If you bring many
                  flowers in the same container, separate them into layers with
                  the moist paper towels. <br />

                  <strong>How do I clean flowers?</strong> <br />
                  <br />
                  The dominant flavor in flowers comes from the pollen and
                  nectar, which are easily rinsed away. Instead of washing them,
                  put the freshly picked flowers on a moist kitchen towel near
                  an open window so small insects can fly or crawl away.
                  <br />Some flowers (like elderflower) have very bitter stalks,
                  so cut them off as close to the flower head as possible, and
                  remove any remnants of grass and withered leaves.

                  <br />
                  A fruit picker can be a big help when trying to reach fruits
                  on trees—a ladder or a strong crate to stand on is also an
                  option. Bring a basket or box to carry the fruits. If you plan
                  to pick enough to fill several boxes, it helps if they can be
                  stacked. <br />Don’t pile your harvest too high, or the fruits
                  on the bottom will be crushed. But they also need to be packed
                  snug to avoid spilling during transportation. <br />If you are
                  moving the fruit over long distances, it is a good idea to
                  wrap them in newspapers so they don't roll around and get
                  bruised. <br />
                  <br />
                  <br /><strong>How do I pick fruit? </strong><br />
                  <br />Fruits are ready for picking if you twist them 360
                  degrees and they let go of the branch without a struggle. If
                  they hold fast, they are not ripe yet, and should be left on
                  the branch. Ripe fruit has dark brown or almost black seeds,
                  while immature seeds will be lighter. <br />Be careful not to
                  bruise the ripe fruits when picking them: even a small bump
                  can attract mold. <br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>How do I store fruit?</strong> <br />
                  <br />Every fruit has its own storage needs, but most prefer
                  dry, dark, and cold places. Apples and pears keep for months
                  if you store them correctly. <br />Regularly check your fruits
                  for mold, and remove any affected specimens as quickly as
                  possible to avoid spoiling the rest of the harvest.

                  <strong>When should I forage for herbs?</strong> <br />
                  <br />
                  Most herbs have several parts that are edible — as long as
                  they are green - but different parts are good at different
                  times. <br />
                  Initially, the herb will make leaves that are fresh and full
                  of flavor. But eventually the herb will shift its efforts to
                  flowering, often causing the leaves to become bitter and
                  develop a woody consistency—especially if exposed to direct
                  sunlight. <br />Finally, at the end of its cycle, an herb will
                  produce tasty seeds.<br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>
                    What kind of equipment do I need when foraging herbs?
                  </strong>
                  <br />
                  <br />Bring gloves in case you find stinging nettles, a
                  vegetable knife or small pair of scissors for cutting tough
                  stalks without destroying the plant, and bags or containers
                  with lids of different sizes for storage. <br />Finally, bring
                  a backpack or basket to carry everything you harvest. <br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>How do I pick herbs? </strong> <br />
                  <br />When it comes to weeds, you can bring home the whole
                  plant and cut the stalk just above the ground. When picking
                  herbs it is best to snip or cut right above a set of leaves on
                  the stem, so the plant can regrow. Put the parts of the plant
                  in the small bags or containers with a lid, and avoid exposing
                  them to direct sunlight. <br />If you’re storing your harvest
                  in a bag, wrap a wet towel around it to keep the plants cool
                  on the way home.<br />
                  <br />
                  <strong> How do I clean herbs?</strong> <br />
                  <br />
                  Clean the herbs with cold water as soon as you get home,
                  dividing them into several batches for easy cleaning and to
                  avoid squishing each other. A salad spinner makes it easy, but
                  you can also use a strainer under running water. <br />
                  Be careful when cleaning some of the more delicate herbs, so
                  they don’t break. Wash them carefully and put them on a
                  kitchen towel to air dry for half an hour. <br />
                  <br />
                  <strong
                    >Do I need to be careful of anything when foraging
                    herbs?</strong
                  >
                  <br />
                  <br />You can eat most herbs, but they are not all tasty, and
                  a few are poisonous. Study toxic varieties in the area before
                  you pick, and never take an herb if you are in doubt. Ramson,
                  for example, looks a bit like the poisonous lily of the
                  valley.<br />
                  Be particularly careful with plants from the carrot family,
                  which comprises poisonous plants like hemlock, fool's parsley,
                  or cowbane.<br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>How do I store herbs?</strong> <br />
                  <br />
                  Most herbs keep for a couple of weeks in the fridge in an
                  airtight container. Put a moist piece of cloth in the bottom
                  of the container, and don't pack the herbs very snug.
                  <br /><br />Some herbs can be dried without losing any flavor,
                  if you want to extend their shelf life. To do this, use a
                  fan-assisted oven with the door open, using the fan but no
                  heat. Turn them once in a while and in a day or two they
                  should be completely dry. At that point, pack them in hermetic
                  containers to avoid any fungus.

                  <strong>Where can I pick leaves and shoots? </strong> <br />
                  <br />If you are after leaves and shoots from trees, it is
                  important that you determine who owns the area you are
                  foraging in, and ask for their permission. <br />For example,
                  the vast majority of spruce plantations are commercial, so it
                  is possible that the pine forest you’re exploring is private
                  property.<br /><br />
                  <strong>When are the leaves and shoots best? </strong>
                  <br />
                  <br />The shoots on trees are best right before they open, and
                  the leaves are best when they are bright green and have a
                  matte surface. Spruce shoots are best when bright green, and
                  soft and rubbery to the touch. <br />

                  A pair of scissors and a container (or bag) is all you’ll
                  need. <br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>How do I pick leaves and shoots? </strong> <br />
                  <br />You can pick the fresh leaves directly from the tree or
                  bush. Shoots from deciduous trees that have yet to open can be
                  gently plucked off the branches with your fingers to avoid
                  damaging the rest of the branch. Carefully snip off shoots
                  just above the outermost light green spot. <br />It can be
                  tough on the plant or tree to have its leaves and shoots cut
                  off, so always take a smaller amount from several branches or
                  plants, rather than all from a single one. Put the plant parts
                  in small plastic bags or containers, and avoid exposing them
                  to direct sunlight. <br />If you store the leaves in bags,
                  wrap a wet towel around them to keep your harvest cool on the
                  way home. <br />

                  <br />
                  Rinse carefully and let them dry in open air.

                  <strong>What kinds of mushroom can I find? </strong> <br />
                  <br />
                  There are many different types of mushroom, each with their
                  own unique look.
                  <br />However, most mushrooms are identifiable by their stem
                  and cap. <br />Under the cap are either gills or pores. Pores
                  are small holes, and gills look like strings going from the
                  outer rim of the cap to the stem. <br />Generally, mushrooms
                  with pores under their caps (<strong>boletaceae</strong>) are
                  edible and tasty, and there is virtually no risk in picking
                  and eating them. <br />You need to be more careful with gilled
                  mushrooms: they can be delicious, but a lot of them have a
                  foul taste, and some are poisonous. Many other mushrooms don't
                  look like mushrooms at all, but can be eaten —if you know how
                  to handle them. <br />

                  <br />
                  <br />A small knife, a brush, and a capacious basket are the
                  most important tools for a mushroom hunt. <br />
                  <br />

                  <strong>How do I pick the mushrooms?</strong> <br />
                  <br />
                  Any mushroom with a thick stem (such as boletaceae) can be cut
                  at its base. Mushrooms with more fragile stems should be
                  picked by hand. Before putting it in your basket, carve open
                  the mushroom to make sure it is not infested with worms.

                  <strong>How do I clean mushrooms?</strong> <br />
                  <br />
                  Use your brush to remove leaves or dirt from the mushrooms
                  before putting them in the basket. When you get home, you can
                  clean them more thoroughly with the brush, but rinsing them in
                  water should be a last resort: mushrooms soak up liquid,
                  turning the springy meat dull and soggy. <br />

                  Both the death cap and the European destroying angel are
                  common, and potentially deadly. Less toxic mushroom varieties
                  will give you stomach aches. In sum, only eat the mushroom if
                  you are certain which type it is. <br />If there is any doubt,
                  there is no doubt: leave unidentified fungi alone. <br />

                  <strong>How do I store mushrooms? </strong> <br />
                  <br />Fresh mushrooms should be stored in the fridge, in a
                  paper bag or similar container that lets them breathe. Most
                  mushrooms keep for three to four days when stored this way,
                  but boletaceae quickly become flaccid and rubbery, thus
                  demanding immediate consumption. <br />A lot of mushrooms can
                  be frozen or dried if you want to extend the mushroom season
                  in your kitchen. Thawed or macerated mushrooms might not be as
                  interesting as their fresh kin, but they are perfect in stews
                  and risotto. <br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>How do I dry mushrooms?</strong> <br />
                  <br />
                  Not all mushrooms tolerate being dried, so first be sure their
                  type is amenable to the process. Quick drying takes four to
                  five hours at 50C in a fan-assisted oven. <br />Cut the
                  mushrooms into thin slices before putting them in the oven.
                  Open the door once in a while to let the steam out. You can
                  also dry the mushrooms on a heater for about 24 hours, or
                  simply put them on a paper towel in a room with a draft for a
                  couple of days. <br />Dried mushrooms can be stored in an
                  airtight container for about a year, and can be macerated in
                  water in a couple of hours. <br />
                  <br />
                  <strong> How do I freeze mushrooms? </strong> <br />
                  <br />If you want to freeze the mushrooms you should cut them
                  into smaller bits and blanch or fry them for a couple of
                  minutes. The frozen mushrooms will keep for up to a year, if
                  you haven't used any fat in the frying pan.<br />
                  If you fry them in fat before freezing them, they only keep
                  for half that time; the upside to using fat is that you can
                  take them from the freezer and pour them directly into your
                  dish.
