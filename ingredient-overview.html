            <h2>Ingredients in the forest during winter</h2>
            <p>Temperature, available light, and precipitation change tremendously over the course of the year, creating
                a wide variety of conditions for plant life. When you forage in a deciduous forest, use the season to
                interpret the landscape. The weather, in other words, will determine
                whether you return from a coniferous forest with a feast or an empty basket.</p>
            <p>Once the leaves fall you should set your sights on mushrooms in particular. Keep an eye on temperature
                and the dampness of the soil (these will determine where mushrooms grow) and remember that mushrooms
                emerge in the wake of a good rain.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="season-container spring">
            <h2>Ingredients in the forest during spring</h2>
            <p>The first herbs of spring to appear in coniferous forests are white dead nettles and sand leek, which pop
                up in patches where they can get sunlight. If the soil is a bit damp, you'll also find wood sorrel, not
                only in spring, but year round. At the end of April you can pick shoots from Scotch pines, and in
                clearings you may be lucky enough to find newly sprouted rowan leaves. From May saffron milk caps pop up
                in bright, open areas beyond the tall grass and near Scotch pines.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="season-container summer">
            <h2>Ingredients in the forest during summer</h2>
            <p>Gathering in coniferous forests is best left for late summer and fall, but if it's been a particularly
                dry or wet summer, there won't be much to find. That said, it only takes a favorable microclimate to
                change everything; one good downpour followed by a handful of warm days creates optimal growing
                conditions for mushrooms. Some mushrooms pop up quickly and in large numbers, but they also dry up again
                if the heat continues and the environment turns too dry. The weather, in other words, will determine
                whether you return from a coniferous forest with a feast or an empty basket.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="season-container fall">
            <h2>Ingredients in the forest during fall</h2>
            <p>In fall, the deciduous forest offers mushrooms, nuts, and fruit. In areas with full sun or a bit of shade
                you can find ripe blackberries, but once the leaves fall you should set your sights on mushrooms in
                particular. Keep an eye on temperature and the dampness of the soil (these will determine where
                mushrooms
                grow) and remember that mushrooms emerge in the wake of a good rain.</p>
            <p>Beginning in August, a coniferous forest becomes a real wonderland. The explosion of different varieties
                of mushrooms makes things really exciting.</p>
