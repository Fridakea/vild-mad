            <h2>Ingredients in the forest during winter</h2>
            <p>Temperature, available light, and precipitation change tremendously over the course of the year, creating
                a wide variety of conditions for plant life. When you forage in a deciduous forest, use the season to
                interpret the landscape. The weather, in other words, will determine
                whether you return from a coniferous forest with a feast or an empty basket.</p>
            <p>Once the leaves fall you should set your sights on mushrooms in particular. Keep an eye on temperature
                and the dampness of the soil (these will determine where mushrooms grow) and remember that mushrooms
                emerge in the wake of a good rain. Many mushrooms stick around until the first frost sets in, and winter
                and oyster mushrooms even endure in December.</p>

        <div class="season-container spring">
            <h2>Ingredients in the forest during spring</h2>
            <p>Before trees’ leaves open, sunlight reaches the forest floor easily and fosters good growing conditions
                for wild herbs, onions, spring mushrooms like common morels, and edible flowers like violets. In spring
                you can forage anywhere in the forest.</p>
            <p>The first herbs of spring to appear in coniferous forests are white dead nettles and sand leek, which pop
                up in patches where they can get sunlight. If the soil is a bit damp, you'll also find wood sorrel—not
                only in spring, but year round. At the end of April you can pick shoots from Scotch pines, and in
                clearings you may be lucky enough to find newly sprouted rowan leaves. From May saffron milk caps pop up
                in bright, open areas beyond the tall grass and near Scotch pines.</p>

        <div class="season-container summer">
            <h2>Ingredients in the forest during summer</h2>
            <p>Gathering in coniferous forests is best left for late summer and fall, but if it's been a particularly
                dry or wet summer, there won't be much to find. That said, it only takes a favorable microclimate to
                change everything; one good downpour followed by a handful of warm days creates optimal growing
                conditions for mushrooms. Some mushrooms pop up quickly and in large numbers, but they also dry up again
                if the heat continues and the environment turns too dry. The weather, in other words, will determine
                whether you return from a coniferous forest with a feast or an empty basket.</p>
            <p>As tree crowns develop over the course of summer, they steal most of the sunlight. The herbs of spring
                wither and die, and sunlight becomes the most important factor to keep in mind while foraging. In shady
                parts of the forest you’ll find wood sorrel and garlic mustard, while wild raspberries and sweet
                woodruff grow in clearings, and wild strawberries populate wide open glades. Beginning in June, golden
                chanterelles pop up in small clearings. Foraging is especially good along forest trails, near fallen
                trees, and where the forest meets fields and meadows.</p>

            <p>Gathering in coniferous forests is best left for late summer and fall, but if it's been a particularly

                whether you return from a coniferous forest with a feast or an empty basket.</p>
            <p>In fall, the deciduous forest offers mushrooms, nuts, and fruit. In areas with full sun or a bit of shade
                you can find ripe blackberries, but once the leaves fall you should set your sights on mushrooms in
                particular. Keep an eye on temperature and the dampness of the soil (these will determine where
                mushrooms
                grow) and remember that mushrooms emerge in the wake of a good rain.</p>
            <p>Beginning in August, a coniferous forest becomes a real wonderland. The explosion of different varieties
                of mushrooms makes things really exciting. If it has rained enough and temperatures are still warm,
                you’ll find Karl Johan mushrooms in clearings
                and along forest paths. Mushroom season typically lasts until October, or until the first frost sets in.
